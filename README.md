# fare-split-issues
Busines rules and requirements for Fare Split

This repository will serve as a requirement / issues repository.

Since private repositories are pais, code for now will be in bitbucket. Github will be used for wiki and issue tracker for now.

Also I will be able to compare these two providers and later decide which one I want to use more heavily
